				<p>
					This documentation attempts to teach computer programming to the
					complete beginner using the C language. As such, it assumes you have
					no knowledge whatsoever about programming. And if you are worried that
					you are not good at high-school mathematics, don’t be. It is a myth
					that you must be good at mathematics to learn programming. In this
					documentation, knowledge of primary school mathematics is all that is
					required—basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
					finding the percentage of some quantity, finding an average or the
					larger of two quantities.
				</p>
				<p>
					The main goal of this documentation is to teach fundamental
					programming principles using C, one of the most widely used
					programming languages in the world today. C is considered a ‘modern’
					language even though its roots date back to the 1970s. Originally, C
					was designed for writing ‘systems’ programs—things like operating
					systems, editors, compilers, assemblers and input/ output utility
					programs. But, today, C is used for writing all kinds of applications
					programs as well—word processing programs, spreadsheet programs,
					database management programs, accounting programs, games, educational
					software—the list is endless.

				<p>
					Well, In order to write our first C programing code we can use any
					text edtior even our default notepad in Computers. Although default
					notepad is an option but to make our life easy we can use Code-Block
					application which have so many cool options, and helps us to write our
					code faster.
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<h3>Steps to setup Code-Block</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Goto http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads. Click "Download the binary
						release". Select your operating platform (e.g., Windows
						2000/XP/Vista/7). Download the installer with GCC Compiler, e.g.,
						codeblocks-13.12mingw-setup.exe (98 MB) (which includes MinGW's GNU
						GCC compiler and GNU GDB debugger).
					</li>
					<li>Run the downloaded installer. Accept the default options.</li>
				</ol>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Verify the Compiler's and Debugger's Path</b>: (For CodeBlocks
						13.12 For Windows) Goto "Settings" menu ⇒ "Compiler..." ⇒ In
						"Selected Compiler", choose "GNU GCC Compiler" ⇒ Select tab
						"Toolchain Executables" ⇒ Check the "Compiler's Installation
						Directory". It shall be set to the "MinGW" sub-directory of the
						CodeBlocks installation directory, for example, suppose that
						CodeBlocks is installed in "c:\Program Files\codeblocks", set it to
						"c:\Program Files\codeblocks\MinGW".
					</li>
					<li>
						Similarly, check the debugger's path. Goto "Settings" menu ⇒
						"Debugger..." ⇒ Expand "GDB/CDB debugger" ⇒ Select "Default" ⇒ In
						"Executable path", provide the full-path name of "gdb.exe", for
						example, "c:\Program Files\codeblocks\MinGW\bin\gdb.exe".
					</li>
				</ul>

					It is not too important that you understand anything about this
					program at this time.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						But you can observe that a C program has something (a function)
						called main followed by opening and closing brackets.
					</li>
					<li>
						Between the left brace { and the right brace } we have what is
						called the body of the function.
					</li>
					<li>
						The statement |<code>int a, s;</code>| is called a declaration.
					</li>
					<li>
						The parts after // are comments that help to explain the program but
						have no effect when the program is run.
					</li>
					<li>And * is used to denote multiplication.</li>
					<p>
						All of these terms will be explained in detail in due
						course.Finally, a program written in a high-level language is
						usually referred to as a source program or source code.
					</p>

				<header><h2>How a Computer Executes a Program</h2></header>
				<p>
					First, recall that a computer can execute a program written in machine
					language only. For the computer to execute the instructions of such a
					program, those instructions must be loaded into the computer’s memory
					(also called primary storage), like this:
				</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>memory</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>instruction 1</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>instruction 2</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>instruction 3</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>etc.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>
					You can think of memory as a series of storage locations, numbered
					consecutively starting at 0. Thus you can speak of memory location 27
					or memory location 31548. The number associated with a memory location
					is called its address.
				</p>
				<p>
					A computer runs a program by executing its first instruction, then the
					second, then the third, and so on. It is possible that one instruction
					might say to jump over several instructions to a particular one and
					continue executing from there. Another might say to go back to a
					previous instruction and execute it again.
				</p>
				<p>
					No matter what the instructions are, the computer faithfully executes
					them exactly as specified. That is why it is so important that
					programs specify precisely and exactly what must be done. The computer
					cannot know what you intend, it can only execute what you actually
					write. If you give the computer the wrong instruction, it will blindly
					execute it just as you specify.

				<code
					>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br />
					int main() {<br />
					printf("Welcome to Trinidad & Tobago");<br />
					}</code
				>
				<p>
					The statement
					<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code><br>
					is called a compiler directive. This simply means that it
					providesinformation the compiler needs to compile your program. In
					C,input/output instructions are provided by means of standard
					functionsstored in a standard library. These functions use variable
					(and other)declarations stored in a special header file called
					stdio.h. Any program that uses an input/output instruction (such as
					printf) mustinform the compiler to include the declarations in the
					file stdio.hwith the program. If this is not done, the compiler will
					not know howto interpret the input/output statements used in the
					program
				</p>
				<p>
					A C program consists of one or more functions (or, subprograms), one
					of which must be called main. Our solution consists of just one
					function so it must be called main. The (round) brackets after main
					are necessary because, in C, a function name is followed by a list of
					arguments, enclosed in brackets. If there are no arguments, the
					brackets must still be present. Here, main has no arguments so the
					brackets alone are present. The word int before main indicate the
					typeof value returned by main. We will explain this in more detail
					later.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every function has a section called the body of the function. The body
					is where the work of the function is performed. The left and right
					braces, { and }, are used to define the start and end, respectively,
					of the body. In C, one or more statements enclosed by { and } is
					called a block or compound statement.
				</p>
				<p>body of main contains one statement:</p>
				<code>printf("Welcome to Trinidad & Tobago");</code>
				<p>
					printf is a standard output function that, in this example, takes one
					argument, a string constant "Welcome to Trinidad & Tobago". Note that,
					as with all functions, the argument is enclosed in round brackets. The
					semicolon is used to indicate the end of the statement. We say the
					semicolon terminates the statement. When executed, this statement will
					print
				</p>
				<code>Welcome to Trinidad & Tobago</code>
